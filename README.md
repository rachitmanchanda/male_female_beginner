# male_female_beginner
Created a dataset on lists and then tried to figure out using Decision Trees in SKLearn whether the following input given is a male or a female. It is a beginners project.

This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1'. The code uses the scikit-learn machine learning library to train a decision tree on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.
